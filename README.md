# College Coursework
Collection and timeline of coursework done at Sonoma State University.
Below are description of said courses taken at SSU.

## [CS115 - Programming I (Taken Fall 2019)](https://github.com/emendoz/College_Coursework/tree/main/CS115)
This course gives an overview of computer organization; arithmetic and logical 
expressions, decision and iteration, simple I/O; subprograms; principles of good 
programming style, readability, documentation, structured programming 
concepts; top-down design and refinements; techniques of debugging 
and testing. Use of the above concepts will be implemented in a standard high-level 
programming language. 

## CS210 - Introduction to Unix (Taken Spring 2020)
This course is an introduction to the use of Linux/Unix as a programming 
environment. Communicating with a Linux host, shells and shell commands, files 
and directories, Gnome desktop, jobs and processes, scripting, programming 
utilities (compiler, linker, debugger, make, hex dump, etc.). 

## CS215 - Programming II (Taken Spring 2020)
This course is the sequel to CS 115. Topics include: pointers and dynamic 
allocation of storage, linked lists, an introduction to the object oriented 
programming (OOP) paradigm, classes and objects, encapsulation, member 
variables and member functions, inheritance and polymorphism, scoping, 
templates, iterators, and error handling techniques. 

## CS242 - Discrete Structures for Computer Science (Taken Fall 2020)
This course covers fundamental mathematical concepts blended with their 
applications in Computer Science. Topics include: sets, functions and relations, 
Boolean algebra, normal forms., Karnaugh map and other minimization 
techniques, predicate logic, formal and informal proof techniques, relational 
algebra, basic counting techniques, recurrence relations, and an introduction to 
graph theory. 

## CS252 - Introduction to Computer Organization (Taken Spring 2021)
This course looks at the interface between computer hardware and software by 
introducing computer architecture and low-level programming. Topics to be 
covered include: data representations, digital logic, combinational and 
sequential circuits, computer system organization from the machine language 
point of view, and assembly language implementation of high-level constructs. 

## CS315 - Data Structures (Taken Spring 2021)
This course introduces the concept of the organization of data into different 
structures to support the efficient implementation of computer algorithms. The 
emphasis of the course is on the internal representation of the elementary and 
intermediate data structures, their time and space requirements, and their 
applications. A second component of the course is the study of more advanced 
features of object-oriented programming. 

## CS351 - Computer Architecture (Taken Fall 2021)
This course is the sequel to CS 252 and includes the following topics: instruction 
set design; stages of instruction execution: data, and control path design; 
pipelining; program optimization techniques; memory hierarchy; cache models 
and design issues; virtual memory and secondary storage; I/O interfacing. 
Advanced topics to include some of the following: parallel architectures, DSP or 
other special purpose architecture, FPGA, reconfigurable architecture, and 
asynchronous circuit design.

## [CS355 - Database Management Systems Design (Taken Fall 2020)](https://github.com/emendoz/College_Coursework/tree/main/CS355/CourseDatabase)
This course focuses on the theoretical as well as the practical aspects of modern 
database systems.Topics include the study of the entity-relationship (E/R) model, 
relational algebra, data normalization, XML as a semi-structured data model, data 
integrity, and database administration. Current tools and technologies are used 
to create and manipulate sample databases. 

## [CS375 - Computer Graphics (Taken Fall 2021)](https://github.com/emendoz/College_Coursework/tree/main/CS375)
An introduction to computer graphics. Survey of the fundamental algorithms and 
methodologies, including, but not limited to, polygon fill, line-drawing, 
antialiasing, geometric transformations, viewing and clipping, spline 
representation, occlusion and visible surface detection, illumination, texturing, 
color models, rendering, shaders, animation, and emerging techniques.

## CS385 - ( Spring 2022 )

## CS415 - Algorithm Analysis ( Spring 2022 )
This course provides a systematic approach to the design and analysis of 
algorithms with an emphasis on efficiency. Topics include algorithms for 
searching and sorting, hashing, exploring graphs, and integer and polynomial 
arithmetic. Foundations in recurrence relations, combinatorics, probability, and 
graph theory as used in algorithm analysis are covered. Standard design 
techniques such as divide-and-conquer, greedy method, dynamic programming, 
heuristics, and probabilistic algorithms along with NP-completeness and 
approximation algorithms are included.
